#####Intro
We have to start at some point. For me, it was Techrise. A person with no idea about HTML and webpage designing, is now able to the things you are seeing right now with a month of training with Techrise. I feel very lucky to be able to take part in this campaign by Techrise.

#####Why Techrise
Techrise is a place where you can learn new stuffs in a friendly environment. Do you plan on learning webpage development but have no idea where to start? Techrise is here. Have trouble to talk with teachers? Techrise gives you a friendly environment where you don't have to feel scared or have lot of burden. This is a place where you will learn as long as you devote your passion.

#####Things I did in One Month in Techrise
In Techrise, the first thing I learned was basic HTML. I had to make a my HTML page and submit it. I had my exams going on, I asked to extend my submission date. I worked day and night after my exam to complete my project. I thought that it would be easy now. I was wrong. I had to devote lot of times after that as well. At one point, I had feeling of quitting. I was taking it for granted. But as the lessons went on, I got to know more cool stuffs I could do. The things that I could only imagine a week ago, I can do that now. I am devoting most of the time in Techrise course now rather than college course.

Techrise has weekly mentor session, providing a time to talk with your mentor. If you have problem talking in mass like me, Techrise gives you this awesome facility. You can ask stuffs you like, you can learn new things in the discusion and ... have fun!
At last, thanks Techrise for providing me the opportunity to learn things. I still have a long way to go and learn from you guys. Hope I can build up to your expectation.asdasd
