<h2 style = "font-size: 25px;"> Life as an intern at Techrise </h2>

I still remember one of my math teacher told me that there will be a time in every person's life where you will find your turning point that will change everything. <strong> You may find local maxima or local minima and that will be your turning point. </strong> After my slc, +2 and till the 5th semester of CSIT, I was still waiting for my turning point. Hoping and trying everything to change the daily routine of playing games, watching anime and trying to code on my own.

So, how am I feeling right now after taken as an intern? It's not much of different than the time while I was taking course at Techrise, but what's really different about it is that I get more motivation everyday and I get to work on the actual projects. It's an amazing place to be and to work at. We don't just work day and night. We have fun, talk, share ideas on how to work on the projects, learn new things and some random stuffs just to fool around at the work.

After joining Techrise as an intern, I have learned better things that were left on the regular courses. I had to work hard and still working hard everyday. <strong> I have come hundred steps forward than when I joined but still thousand steps behind where I have to be. </strong> I still play games, still watch one anime per night and have college to attend. Life has been tough these 2 months around, but what's fun is that I have some goal to meet up. The second to primary things I used to do : playing games, watching animes; they have come to the secondary things. It would be great if I get to stop them completly, but again, one small step at a time right?

At Techrise's intern, it's not about just working on the project. I have heard lots of things about intern from friends and family that it's hard, it's like a job where your boss yields at you, you have no friends and so on. I can't say about the interns after sometime, but for me, everyone was the same face when I joined the team that were on the learning phase. Some were already on the core team while I was on the learning phase, but due to the lots of workshops and interactive classes at Techrise, it was like the regular days. I just go in the office, do what I have been assigned, search for the stuffs that I don't know and then ask if I get stucked at something or somewhere.

So, it's the life I have been living for 2 months now. The timing problem is really hard on me as I am poor in managing stuffs. I code for whole day someday and the next day, I will be playing the whole day. Reading course books...nah, not really! I hope to do better and hope to not laze around. 


<script>
var myIndex = 0;
carousel();

function carousel() {
    var i;
    var x = document.getElementsByClassName("Photos");
    for (i = 0; i < x.length; i++) {
       x[i].style.display = "none";  
    }
    myIndex++;
    if (myIndex > x.length) {myIndex = 1}    
    x[myIndex-1].style.display = "block";  
    setTimeout(carousel, 2000); // Change image every 2 seconds
}
</script>
