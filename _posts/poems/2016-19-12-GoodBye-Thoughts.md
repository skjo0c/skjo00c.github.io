I guess we can say it's over,<br>
The moments we had shared came to closer.<br>
Maybe we could meet some other time,<br>
When I wouldn't be able to say you're mine.<br><br>

Twisted and tangled,<br>
Our love was like a hurricane.<br>
A little bit of joy and lot of pain.<br><br>

It's hard to go back to that day,<br>
I wish I could havev said.<br>
Every word, every phrase,<br>
Things I think now in my head.<br>
I would trade.<br>
Give away all the words that I saved,<br>
In my heart<br>
That was left unsaid.<br><br>

But it's fine, it's over now.<br>
You are similing again,<br>
Like that day I first saw you in grown.<br>
Why would it matter,<br>
Even if the reason was not me now!<br><br>
