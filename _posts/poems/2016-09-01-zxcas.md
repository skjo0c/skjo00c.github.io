I was happy living my beautiful life without you. 

Past memories that never interfered with my present.

Denial was my solace.

Faded away into healing. 

You made yourself a nice cozy home inside me.

You represent the past which is filled with suffering, 

You have engulfed me in this horrible wretchedness.

Constantly convincing myself you are simply the past.

You are not an active force in my present or future. 

 You are simply memories that won't go away. 

The challenge I face is living with you inside me, 

Getting inhaled by the sadness and despair.

Dealing with you is a daily punishment, 

What about you? 

I wonder what your punishment is? 

Why must I live my life with such injustice?

I should have never kept you a hidden secret.

In my vault, locked aways for thirty years.

 All I want is for you to go, move on, and leave me alone.

You won’t though. 

You will continue to hibernate inside me with no plans to ever leave. 

This is my reality... 

I need to let you go.

I am forever trapped with you, 

my haunting memories, you are a piece of me.

Finding a way where we can coexist together, without your presence suffocating me.

Patience will be my best ally.

I am optimistic that one day, you will no longer be overwhelming me.

Your remains have harmed my entire being,

Yet, you pose no physical threat to me anymore. 

Those days have long passed.  

Healing from you doesn’t come easy for me.

It is an exhausting challenge I seem to struggle with.

A constant urge to go numb and hide from your wrath, 

Knowing that hiding is not the path to my healing.

Controlling and trying to tackle you in my home.

The anticipation of a fair fight has left me feeling anxious and nervous.

This is not a fair fight, even though I have the home advantage. 

Resilience, determination, and stamina will be needed.

Creating peace with you, will ease my internal pain from you.

Peace within myself despite your existence.
