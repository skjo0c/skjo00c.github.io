I remember…
It was 1 am,
When I couldn’t sleep.
You made me laugh,
When I was fighting hard to breathe.
Enticing me with words very few,
You would stay, somehow I knew.

Slowly…
Rain stopped,
And autumn came.
You promised, 
You would never change.
Like seasons do,
That was exactly when I fell for you.

You were the star,
Twinkling vibrantly,
When the moon had stopped shining.

You were the music,
That soothed me,
When the words had stopped rhyming.

And I believe…
Your touch,
Will heal my every pain.
Your smile,
Is that balmy sunshine after the rain.
Blissful or broken,
My lips will have your name.
Coz in this frenzied world,
You are the madness that keeps me sane.
