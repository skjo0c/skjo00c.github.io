“Bye”<br/>
One word,<br/>
That I dread.<br/>
“Bye”<br/>
One word,<br/>
You said you would never say to me!<br/>

“Bye”<br/>
One word,<br/>
You didn’t say,<br/>
But said it thousand times,<br/>
Wasn’t it a bye when you kept quiet?<br/>
When all I needed,<br/>
Was your words!<br/>
Wasn’t it bye when I cried all night?<br/>
But all you heard were perfect rhymes!<br/>

Every John Mayer songs,<br/>
You whispered to me<br/>
Still fresh in my head,<br/>
Like morning breeze.<br/>
The poems you wrote,<br/>
Were that all lie?<br/>
Didn’t you feel a thing?<br/>
When you left me to die!<br/>

And I wonder what went wrong,<br/>
When did we stop singing those songs?<br/>
Those John Mayer and Taylor Swift fight,<br/>
All the wrongs you did,<br/>
I took it right.<br/>
All those promises,<br/>
Of happy days,<br/>
Did they just drift away?<br/>

The colours you brought to my life,<br/>
Are now all blemishes, too hard to hide!<br/>
Love, now seems like a labyrinth,<br/>
Beyond our reach,<br/>
They say love is forever,<br/>
But ours ceased!<br/>
The tale of our tainted love ends here,<br/>
These words are for you to read somewhere out there!<br/>

‘Bye’<br/>
One word you said you would never say to me,<br/>
Today I say,<br/>
As a vengeance,<br/>
For your thousand misdemeanour, <br/>
And thousand lies,<br/>
Darling,<br/>
It’s a final goodbye!<br/>
