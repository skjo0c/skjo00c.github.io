“Bye”

One word,

That I dread.

“Bye”

You said you would never say to me!

“Bye”

One word,

You didn’t say,

But said it thousand times,

Wasn’t it a bye when you kept quiet?

When all I needed,

Was your words!

Wasn’t it bye when I cried all night?

But all you heard were perfect rhymes!

Every John Mayer songs,

You whispered to me

Still fresh in my head,

Like morning breeze.

The poems you wrote,

Were that all lie?

Didn’t you feel a thing?

When you left me to die!

And I wonder what went wrong,

When did we stop singing those songs?

Those John Mayer and Taylor Swift fight,

All the wrongs you did,

I took it right.

All those promises,

Of happy days,

Did they just drift away?

The colours you brought to my life,

Are now all blemishes, too hard to hide!

Love, now seems like a labyrinth,

Beyond our reach,

They say love is forever,

But ours ceased!

The tale of our tainted love ends here,

These words are for you to read somewhere out there!

‘Bye’

One word you said you would never say to me,

Today I say,

As a vengeance,

For your thousand misdemeanour, 

And thousand lies,

Darling,

It’s a final goodbye!
