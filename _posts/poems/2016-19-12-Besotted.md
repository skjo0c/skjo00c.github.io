I remember…<br/>
It was 1 am,<br/>
When I couldn’t sleep.<br/>
You made me laugh,<br/>
When I was fighting hard to breathe.<br/>
Enticing me with words very few,<br/>
You would stay, somehow I knew.<br/>

Slowly…<br/>
Rain stopped,<br/>
And autumn came.<br/>
You promised, <br/>
You would never change.<br/>
Like seasons do,<br/>
That was exactly when I fell for you.<br/>

You were the star,<br/>
Twinkling vibrantly,<br/>
When the moon had stopped shining.<br/>

You were the music,<br/>
That soothed me,<br/>
When the words had stopped rhyming.<br/>

And I believe…<br/>
Your touch,<br/>
Will heal my every pain.<br/>
Your smile,<br/>
Is that balmy sunshine after the rain.<br/>
Blissful or broken,<br/>
My lips will have your name.<br/>
Coz in this frenzied world,<br/>
You are the madness that keeps me sane.<br/>
